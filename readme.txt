Hey Jake.
So I trimmed this down as small as I could. There is still probably some stuff in here that you don't need and if you find it you can cut it out as you want.

Your main commands that you need to run to get things going are as follows. They should be run in the root directory (MERN_Boilerplate)

To start your server: npm start
Your server serves up an html page with the bundle.js as the main script. You can see this in MERN_Boilerplate/views/layout.pug
